# Private aggregation & retrieval, federated, analytics, inference, & training from Google

Welcome to Google Parfait! The goal of this organization is to host repositories
for defining and executing machine learning and analytics computations and
workflows that enable strong privacy claims consistent with users’ privacy
expectations, including:

*   Libraries and frameworks used in research simulation
*   Libraries and system components used in Google's production federated
    compute infrastructure
*   Reference architectures for production systems

## Technologies supported

Our repositories support privacy-preserving technologies, including:

*   Federated Learning
*   Federated Analytics
*   Differential Privacy
*   TEE-enabled privacy architectures
*   Personalization & Local Computation
*   Privacy preserving aggregation, including approaches based on differential
    private and secure multiparty computation
*   Private Information Retrieval (PIR)

## Parfait impact

Our technology and research has been used widely across Google, deployed by
other tech companies, and referenced by many others. Some examples include
analytics for

## More about us

We are a team of researchers and engineers at Google that develop foundational
technologies that enable strong privacy guarantees for AI and analytics systems,
and maintain these repositories, which are used in production across various
Google platforms. We believe that strong privacy guarantees are essential to the
future of tech, and are committed to driving innovation in this space. We
encourage engineers and researchers to actively engage with these repositories
and use the code with confidence to build private-by-default systems and publish
papers.
